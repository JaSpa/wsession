\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Session types provide a type discipline for structured communication
in concurrent programming systems.

We concentrate on binary session types, although our proposal should
be extensible to the multi-party setting.

For a long time, session types were inextricably connected to linear
types. This connection has affected their implementation and widespread
adoption. Languages constructed around session types embrace linearity
and their type checker rejects violations thereof. Examples: Links,
Sepi, Sill, C0, more?
While these languages and their implementation have fostered research
and encouraged experimentation, these languages are not widely used.

To boost the use of session types, 
a lot of work is dedicated to embedding session types in mainstream
languages, most of which do not have native support for linearity. 
(Plenty of examples with different trade-offs.)

Recent work on multi-party session types suggests an alternative
approach, reminiscent of the inversion of control approach which is
familiar to programmer from GUI programming. The system described in
that paper compiles a description of a multi-party session type into
a library that encapsulates the implementation of all
communication. For each communication action, the library provides an
interface where the programmer specifies a callback function for this
particular action.

We show how to apply this idea to binary session types in the context
of dependently-typed functional programming. Our vehicle is the
language Agda, so that our development is transferrable to Haskell,
either via compilation or via translation
\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/CockxME0N22}.

\subsection{Finite nonbranching simple session types}
\label{sec:finite-nonbr-simple}

\input{latex/ST-finite-nonbranching.tex}

Let's start straight away with the simplest instance, finite
nonbranching simple session types, to convey the
gist of the approach. Subsequent sections show how to add most of the
usual features of session types.

A binary session type describes a bidirectional communication between two peers,
let's call them server and client. The session type is attached to the
type of the communication channel.
\stFiniteType
These types correspond to the standard grammar of session types, where
$T$ is the type of payloads that can be transmitted and $S$ is the
type of sessions. 
\begin{align*}
  T &::= \Anat & S &::= \Atsend{T}{S} \mid \Atrecv{T}{S} \mid \Atend
\end{align*}
The session type $\Atsend{T}{S}$ ($\Atrecv{T}{S}$) describes a channel that is ready to send (receive)
a value of payload type $T$ and the continue as $S$. The session type
$\Atend$ describes a channel that can only be closed.

Here are two examples for session types: the types of the server for a
binary operation and a unary operation, respectively.
\stExampleBinpUnP

In standard session type theory \cite{???}, there are primitives to
send and receive values and to close a channel with types like this:
\begin{align*}
  \mathtt{send} & : \Atsend{T}{S} \otimes T \multimap S &
                                                   \mathtt{recv} &:
                                                                   \Atrecv{T}{S}
                                                                   \multimap
                                                                   (T
                                                                   \otimes
                                                                   S)
  & \mathtt{close} &: \Atend \multimap ()
\end{align*}
The types indicate that we must treat channel values of type $S$
\emph{linearly}: the \texttt{send} operation \emph{consumes} a
channel, which is ready to send, and returns it in a state described
by $S$; the \texttt{recv} operation \emph{consumes} a channel, which
is ready to receive, and returns a pair with the received value and
the updated channel; the \texttt{close} operation \emph{consumes} the
channel and returns a unit value. Enforcing this linearity is required
for soundness.

We take a different approach inspired by programming with
callbacks. Instead of providing \texttt{send} and \texttt{recv}
primitives to the programmer, we ask the programmer to define the
``application logic'' by implementing a value whose type is indexed by
a session type.
\stCommand
In this definition, the type $A$ embodies the application state. 
Each $\ACSEND$ command takes a state transformer that extracts the value to
send from the current application state; each $\ACRECV$ command takes
a state transformer that is indexed by the received value; the $\ACEND$
command terminates the session. In fact, we could provide the
application logic by actions in a state monad over the application
state $A$. We defer the shift to a monadic interface to the next step,
when we have the full picture.

Continuing our example, we define a command that implements a server
for the protocol {\Abinaryp} with the binary operation instantiated to
addition.
\stAddpCommand
We use the variable $a$ for the application state and $x$ and $y$ for
the value received from the channel.

Finally, we need to execute commands. To this end, we write an
interpreter for commands that relies on primitive operations provided
in the $\AIO$ monad. The point of our approach is that this
interpreter is the single definition where we are obliged to prove
that it handles channels in a linear fashion. 
\stPostulates
This API should be self-explanatory. It declares an abstract type of
channels with operations to accept a connection, close a channel, as
well as send and receive a value over the channel. It glosses over issues like
serialization, which can be addressed using type classes.
% Our shared memory implementation relies on unsafe casts.

The interpreter itself is defined by induction on the type
{\ACommand}.
\stExecutor
To actually run a server, it remains to provide a wrapper that accepts
a connection and invokes the interpreter.
\stAcceptor
Examining the interpreter, we finally see the full monadic
structure. We need stack of monad transformers starting with a state
monad for the application state on top a reader monad providing the
channel on top of the IO monad.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Instead of having commands indexed by session types, we could have
\emph{command fragments} indexed by transformations of session types
($S \to S$). Everything is definable in this way, but defining
protocols is awkward as the type checker is unable to provide
guidance.

Here is an example: (elaborate)
